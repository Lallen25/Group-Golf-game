You should find some example code, an image file, and a Java archive
in a directory called Test.

You can compile and run the example with the commands:

	javac -cp jsfml.jar;. Test.java
	java  -cp jsfml.jar;. Test

Replace the semi-colons with colons if you're trying to test this
on a Unix based system.

Note that the code uses recent Java additions and so needs Java 8.

If running this on your own machine you will need to install SFML
from http://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php

Depending which version of SFML you install you might also need to
the matching Visual C++ (2010, ...) Redistributable Package,
available from Microsoft.
